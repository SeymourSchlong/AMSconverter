# AMSconverter
A converter for AMS songs to SMP songs
---
## How to use
1. Extract the .zip in the [releases page](https://github.com/SeymourSchlong/AMSconverter/releases)  
2. Put the AMS files (.mss) you want to convert into the "input" folder  
3. Open "converter.exe"  
4. Once it closes (which should be very fast), your files will be in the "output"  

## Notes
Currently, since the program is written in nodejs, it needs pkg to compile it. While useful, it tends to create large executable file sizes. So in the meantime, unless there is some way to reduce the file size, it will be a one-time download of ~20MB.
